Description: library embedding HTTP server functionality (development)
 GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make it easy to run
 an HTTP server as part of another application. Key features that distinguish
 GNU Libmicrohttpd from other projects are:
 .
  * C library: fast and small
  * API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
  * Implementation is HTTP 1.1 compliant
  * HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
  * Four different threading models (select, poll, pthread, thread pool)
  * Support for IPv6
  * Support for SHOUTcast
  * Support for incremental processing of POST data (optional)
  * Support for basic and digest authentication (optional)
  * Support for SSL3 and TLS
 .
 This package contains the development files.
